"Found tool wear failure (TWF) anomaly for Product L56756:  the tool will be replaced of fail at a randomly selected tool wear time between 200 - 240 mins (120 times in our dataset). At this point in time, the tool is replaced 69 times, and fails 51 times (randomly assigned). The cause is Tool wear [min] which is 205. A second cause can be Torque [Nm] which is 23.3 "
"Found power failure (PWF) anomaly for Product L56793:  the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails, which is the case 95 times in our dataset. The cause is Torque [Nm] which is 62.5. A second cause can be Rotational speed [rpm] which is 1377 "
